-After inserting pigs, make sure there is at least one column of primary blocks
exist between the left and the right of the pig. I presume that this will
increase the stability of the structure.
-Fix platform insertion logic. Instead of wholesale inserting platforms for a
row, determine the partitions of the row where a platform block is needed and
insert that way. Note that for this logic, you must resolve the platform blocks
that are intersecting. Because of this, it might not be as straightforward as
you thought.
-Whenever a platform block is not inserted, there cannot be a pig placed under
that platform block. This defeats the purpose of generating (but not inserting)
the platform that is located right above the top of the structure. Find a
solution for this.
-In Cat.jpg, some platforms are generated but not inserted. This causes free
falling blocks when you start the level. Find out the reason and fix it.
-Clean up the code that accommodates for edge cases. Such code is spread all
over.
-Understand why Potrace cannot trace some images. This prevents generating
structures from some images.
-Change your script so that it creates the polygon from SVG "path" element
values, instead of from SVG "polygon" values.
-You can calculate the number of platform blocks smarter. That is, calculate it
so that if more than half of a platform block remains outside of the platform
below, use one less platform block for that platform in order to keep that
platform stable. Because if more than half of a platform block is outside
of the structure, this means that the center of gravity of that block is not
within the structure. This can cause stability problems. You can calculate how
much of the block would be outside the structure by comparing the:
1. Width of platform.
2. Width of the row that the platform sits on top.
3. Width of a single platform block.
-You are using tile and block for almost the same thing. Clarify this and
possibly use only one of them.
