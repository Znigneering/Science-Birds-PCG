-Understand why do we need to add/subtract 1 from the index in some places.
Example: In "get_xml_elements_for_pigs". There are more examples about this.
-Change your script so that it creates the polygon from SVG "path" element
values, instead of from SVG "polygon" values.
-You can calculate the number of platform blocks smarter. That is, calculate it
so that if more than half of a platform block remains outside of the platform
below, use one less platform block for that platform in order to keep that
platform stable. Because if more than half of a platform block is outside
of the structure, this means that the center of gravity of that block is not
within the structure. This can cause stability problems. You can calculate how
much of the block would be outside the structure by comparing the:
1. Width of platform.
2. Width of the row that the platform sits on top.
3. Width of a single platform block.
-You are using tile and block for almost the same thing. Clarify this and
possibly use only one of them.
