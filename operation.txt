1. Determine the leftmost, rightmost, topmost and bottommost points of the input
SVG image. For simplicity, assume that the input SVG image consists of only a
single polygon.
2. Decide on your principal block. For simplicity, let's say we will use "tiny
square" for now.
3. Decide on how many principal blocks you want to use on one of the axes. For
simplicity, let's say on X axis.
4. After deciding on how many principal blocks you want to use on one of the
axes (say, X axis), calculate the width and height of the principal block w.r.t
the length of the axis that you choose of the input SVG polygon.
5. For every principal block tile, determine whether or not there should be a
block inserted by calling "is_tile_mostly_in_shape" method and construct the
structure matrix. Do this by starting from top-left and going first towards
right and then one row down. This way, you will go in the natural direction of
SVG coordinates. After the block insertions are completed, you can convert the
blocks to start from bottom-left and go first towards right and then one row
up by calling the "tranpose_and_invert_tiles" method in OpenMosaic.
